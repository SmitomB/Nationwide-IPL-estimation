# Abstract

Internal phosphorus loading (IPL) can be a significant source of phosphorus (P) in freshwater systems. It is often cited for delayed water quality improvement following external load reductions. However, IPL flux estimates are missing for many lakes and reservoirs due to several challenges in large-scale measurement. Moreover, existing models have limited predictive skill or require covariates that may be unavailable at large spatial scales. In this study, we develop a predictive framework, combining random forest and linear mixed-effects regression, to predict summer IPL fluxes along with bottom-water temperature (BT) and waterbody total P (TP) concentration in nearly 6000 large lakes and reservoirs across the contiguous US (CONUS). We also demonstrate a novel approach to propagate the uncertainties across the predictive framework. Our results suggest 57% of waterbodies, largely in cropland areas, are likely to be eutrophic (TP > 35 𝜇g/L). Moreover, we estimate that summer IPL fluxes range from around 1-37 mg/m2/day across CONUS, with 31% of waterbodies having fluxes > 10 mg/m2/day. Summer IPL is likely to be greater than point source loadings in 43% of watersheds. Most of the uncertainty in our IPL estimates can be attributed to BT and TP inputs (estimated through random forest). Overall, our results reveal where IPL is likely to be a critical factor in watershed nutrient management.
